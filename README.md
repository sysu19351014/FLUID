# FLUID: A Fine-Grained Lightweight Urban Signalized-Intersection Dataset of Dense Conflict Trajectories

#### ToDo List

- [x] Upload data processing code

- [x] Upload [Field Descriptions](./docs/field_descriptions.md)

- [ ] Upload data verification code

- [ ] Make the Figshare dataset public (after correction)

- [ ] Related research

#### demo

The main process is data processing, and the order is based on the numbers before the file names.
